# What is this?
this is a BetterDiscord mini-theme that works on top of the default [dark] theme. It'll look okay on most of the elements with the light theme but I won't do anything about it since I mainly use dark mode anyway.

# Installation
Make sure you have BandagedBD or BetterDiscord installed, the put the CSS into the themes directory. Once copied restart your Discord client and enable it within the settings.

It'll update automatically since the CSS will mostly point to the main CSS
